This directory contains the RTTM files we obtained with the model we used in our paper:
Keisuke Kinoshita, Marc Delcroix, and Naohiro Tawara, "Advances in integration of end-to-end neural and clustering-based diarization for real conversational speech," Proc. Interspeech, 2021

You can obtian the rrtm files by doing the following.
$ tar ztf eend-vc_callhome2_hyp_rttm.tar.gz

It will give you the following files, 
a) with oracle number of speakers:

Note that there are very minor difference in performance with the results reported in the paper because we reran the experiments on a different machine.
